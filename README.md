# Predicting Substorm Onsets Using Magnetometer Data

## Problem Statement
### What Am I Trying to Solve?
Over the last several years as an aurora chaser and photographer, one of the major challenges I have faced is accurately predicting substorm onsets that result in stunning auroral displays. Substorms are characterized by a rapid brightening of the aurora, often appearing as a localized arc that quickly expands and leads to more dynamic movements. Accurately detecting the onset of a substorm is one of the most crucial components of being an aurora chaser.

## Observational Challenges
### Visual Indicators of Substorms
People who have spent a significant amount of time in high-latitude auroral regions, especially those who actively chase the aurora, can often visually identify these changes by observing how the aurora shifts in form and intensity. Many times, there are distinct signs that indicate an approaching substorm, such as:

- The aurora suddenly shifts from the northern sky to a more central location relative to the observer.
- The aurora splits from a single band into multiple bands, signaling an imminent substorm.
- The aurora starts spreading out from the band and becomes more dynamic.

### Unpredictable Substorm Onsets
However, through my experience, I have found that some substorms can appear out of nowhere. I have spent multiple nights chasing auroras in the Arctic where the sky was filled with extremely diffuse auroras showing no significant movement—only for it to suddenly burst into colors without any prior visual warning. 

No matter how much I have tried to correlate visual patterns with substorm events, my success has been inconsistent. While I have been able to predict substorms many times, I have also failed on numerous occasions. Over time, I have realized that in order to accurately predict a substorm, I need to take a more deterministic approach.

## The Role of Magnetometers
A substorm is not only characterized by its visual aspects—its intensity changes can also be observed through magnetometer data. A **magnetometer** is a scientific instrument that measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields. Just like our eyes, magnetometers can capture the presence of a substorm. Substorms cause magnetic field disturbances, which can be easily detected through magnetometer readings.

## Understanding Substorm Phases
A substorm progresses through three distinct phases:

### 1. Growth Phase
- Usually begins **1–2 hours before** the Expansion Phase, but can start several hours earlier.
- Marked by a **gradual climb** in magnetometer plots.
- Provides advance warning of the Expansion Phase and an estimate of when it might begin.

### 2. Expansion Phase
- The **most dramatic phase** for aurora hunters.
- The aurora bursts into its **brightest colors and most dynamic movements**.
- **Magnetometer readings dip sharply**, indicating a strong magnetic field disturbance.

### 3. Recovery Phase
- Follows the Expansion Phase.
- The **intense auroral activity diminishes**.
- **Magnetometer readings return to baseline levels**.

## The Advantage of Magnetometer Data
Magnetometers are installed across the Earth at various geographic locations, spanning high, mid, and low latitudes, each detecting the magnetic field in its respective area. If an observer is stationed near an observatory equipped with a magnetometer and can monitor its data, the three phases of a substorm can be identified much more reliably compared to visual interpretation alone.

## Goal
Thus, my goal is to use **local magnetometer data** to accurately predict these three phases of a substorm, improving the ability to anticipate and capture stunning auroral displays.
