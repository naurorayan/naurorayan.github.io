# Predicting Auroral Substorms from Magnetometer Data

Over the last several years as an aurora chaser and photographer, one of the major challenges I have faced is accurately predicting substorm onsets that result in stunning auroral displays. Substorms are characterized by a rapid brightening of the aurora, often appearing as a localized arc that quickly expands and leads to more dynamic movements. Accurately detecting the onset of a substorm is one of the most crucial components of being an aurora chaser.

People who have spent a significant amount of time in high-latitude auroral regions, especially those who actively chase the aurora, can often visually identify these changes by observing how the aurora shifts in form and intensity. Many times, there are distinct signs that indicate an approaching substorm. One such characteristic, particularly near the auroral oval, occurs when the aurora suddenly shifts from the northern sky to a more central location relative to an observer on Earth. Additionally, if the aurora splits from a single band into multiple bands, this is a strong indication that a substorm may be imminent.

However, through my experience, I have found that some substorms can appear out of nowhere. I have spent multiple nights chasing auroras in the Arctic where the sky was filled with extremely diffuse auroras showing no significant movement—only for it to suddenly burst into colors without any prior visual warning. No matter how much I have tried to correlate visual patterns with substorm events, my success has been inconsistent. While I have been able to predict substorms many times, I have also failed on numerous occasions. Over time, I have realized that in order to accurately predict a substorm, I need to take a more deterministic approach.

A substorm is not only characterized by its visual aspects—its intensity changes can also be observed through magnetometer data. A magnetometer is a scientific instrument that measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields. Just like our eyes, magnetometers can capture the presence of a substorm. Substorms cause magnetic field disturbances, which can be easily detected through magnetometer readings.

A substorm progresses through three distinct phases: Growth, Expansion, and Recovery. The Expansion Phase is the one that aurora hunters seek, as this is when the aurora bursts into its brightest colors and most dramatic rays. During this phase, magnetometer readings dip sharply. The Growth Phase usually begins 1–2 hours before the Expansion Phase, though it can start several hours earlier. This phase is typically marked by a gradual climb in magnetometer plots, which can provide advance warning of the Expansion Phase and an estimate of when it might begin. The Recovery Phase follows, during which the intense activity of the Expansion Phase diminishes, and magnetometer readings return to baseline levels.

Magnetometers are installed across the Earth at various geographic locations, spanning high, mid, and low latitudes, each detecting the magnetic field in its respective area. If an observer is stationed near an observatory equipped with a magnetometer and can monitor its data, the three phases of a substorm can be identified much more reliably compared to visual interpretation alone.

Thus, my goal is to use local magnetometer data to accurately predict these three phases of a substorm.

# Challenges

One of the main characteristics of polar substorms is that they are a very common phenomenon near the auroral oval and, most often, are very short-lived. I have witnessed substorms lasting only around 10 to 15 minutes, and the longest I have seen after countless nights of chasing the aurora was probably 40 to 45 minutes. I would say it is extremely rare for the expansion phase of a substorm to last that long. The key challenge is detecting changes over a relatively short time window in which we can accurately capture sudden variations in magnetometer data. There are indices available that interpret magnetometer deflections, but they operate over longer time periods. For example, the extremely popular Kp index works with a 3-hour time window. Additionally, Kp is a global index, aggregating local K indices from several observatories worldwide where magnetometers are installed.

A highly possible and frequently experienced issue is that the Kp index might show a value of 5, which should translate to extremely dynamic auroras near the Fairbanks, Alaska, area. However, for an observer on the ground, that might not be the case. There could be very diffuse auroras overhead at that time, with stronger auroras only visible far in the northeastern sky. This suggests that the contributing factor for a high Kp value may be magnetometers in Central and Eastern Canada, while the College magnetometer near Fairbanks may only be reading a local K index of 2. Therefore, it is crucial to consider data from nearby locations to accurately predict auroral intensity at a given time. However, local K indices also use a 3-hour time window, just like the global Kp index. More often than not, if K or Kp indices are used to detect real-time substorms, the detection will occur after the substorm has already ended. Thus, it is essential to examine shorter time windows and interpret magnetometer data in a way that allows for accurate substorm prediction.

Another drawback of calculating magnetometer deflection ranges within a time period—similar to how the Kp and K indices are determined—is that during large geomagnetic storms, when auroras are pushed down to mid-latitudes, simply calculating the range of deflection may not always provide an accurate picture. In high-latitude substorms, before the growth phase and after the recovery phase, it is common for the magnetometer reading to return to a quiet state before deflecting again when the next substorm appears, which could even be the following night. However, during extreme geomagnetic storms lasting several hours, magnetometers may hover around a much lower value for an extended period. This means they may not show significant deflections in a short time frame, making it difficult to capture substorm activity.

I have personally observed this phenomenon. One night last October, I witnessed the aurora near Blacksburg, VA, where beautiful red pillars appeared across the northern sky and lasted for almost an hour before fading away. When I later checked the K index for both the Boulder, CO, and Fredericksburg, VA, observatories—both located around the same geomagnetic longitude—for that 3-hour period, I saw that the K index was 3 for both observatories. This was clearly incorrect. Seeing such an aurora from Blacksburg, VA, at a geomagnetic latitude of 46 degrees would require at least a K index of 7. However, when I manually calculated the deflection, the range matched the K index scale equivalent to 3. This made sense because the overall curve was hovering at a much lower value for the entire period. In this case, simply measuring the deflection was not enough to determine the actual auroral intensity at that location. This highlights the importance of understanding the quiet magnetic curve on normal, quiet days and hours so that actual deviations can be measured against the quiet curve rather than just the deflection from the current curve within a given time period.

Another challenge is determining the correct auroral intensity with respect to an observer who is far from any station magnetometers. If such an observer wants to detect the onset of a substorm, data from multiple station magnetometers within a certain radius must be analyzed to make a meaningful prediction. While this prediction may not be absolutely accurate, a certain degree of approximation is acceptable. The challenge, however, is that the intensity of magnetic field disturbances detected by a magnetometer varies drastically with geomagnetic latitude. I aim to develop a model that can also be applied to mid- and low-latitude locations. Therefore, incorporating geomagnetic latitude as a key element in the calculations is crucial.

# Approach

Given the many factors involved, I initially ran machine learning linear regression to understand their correlation on a larger scale. I retrieved 1-minute magnetometer data from three different observatories at three different geomagnetic latitudes, covering the period from 2017 to 2025. This timeframe is valuable as it includes both the previous solar minimum and the current solar maximum. I also gathered the corresponding Kp, HP30, HP60, and local K indices for these observatories over the same period.

For each index, I segregated the magnetometer data into corresponding time windows: for K and Kp, data was grouped into three-hour windows; for HP60, into hourly windows; and for HP30, into 30-minute windows. I then performed linear regression on a randomly selected 70% of the data, using the index as the dependent variable and the following as independent variables: magnetometer deflection, mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, geomagnetic latitude, hour of the day, month of the year, and solar flux (to account for the solar cycle phase). I also ran multiple regression versions by selectively removing certain variables.

As expected, when I tested the model with the remaining 30% of the data, predictions were significantly off from actual index values. However, this highlighted the extent of heterogeneity in the data, which became apparent through visual interpretation. One thing became clear: to tackle this problem effectively, I would need a divide-and-conquer approach. I had to determine the right correlations between variables and segment the data into homogeneous sections, even if it appeared heterogeneous overall. The first and most obvious segmentation was based on geomagnetic location. It made sense to break the data into three separate models for high, mid, and low latitudes. Running separate linear regressions for each latitude gave me a much clearer understanding of the data and problem, even though I was still far from an accurate prediction.

Using the root mean square method for verification, I observed that the mean value for each dataset was consistently pushed toward the quiet curve value of the magnetometer. There was also a clear correlation between the mean and factors such as time of day, time of year, and solar cycle phase. The more I analyzed this dataset, the more I realized that instead of focusing on accurately capturing deviations, it would be much more effective to predict the quiet curve first and then calculate deviations from it, mapping those deviations to a scale indicating the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances at a given location.

I conducted further literature reviews to understand the factors influencing quiet curve variation. This led me to J. Bartel’s concept of a Q index, proposed as an improvement over the K index for more accurately predicting substorms and auroras, particularly at high and upper mid-latitudes. The Q index is based on 15-minute magnetometer data intervals and relies on the quiet curve rather than total deviations within a time window. My immediate goal is to further segment the data into multiple sections, such as three-hour daily windows, monthly windows, and two-year windows throughout the solar cycle. I will then analyze the correlation between these and the corresponding K index, considering only periods when the local K index for the magnetometer is below 2, effectively filtering out geomagnetic noise. Once this data is properly segmented, I will rerun regressions. Given the reduced number of independent variables, I will first perform curve plotting to identify relationships between variables, selecting an appropriate regression model, which may include polynomial regressions depending on variable behavior. My goal is to establish a baseline quiet curve for each magnetometer within a given time category. For example, a random timestamp of December 1, 2024, at 2 AM Alaska Time would fall into the bucket of November–December → 0–3 AM → Solar Maximum. The predicted quiet curve for that time would serve as a baseline, and any deviation from it would indicate a potential geomagnetic disturbance.

While this approach is promising, it may not provide sufficient accuracy for field applications where precision is critical. Previous plots clearly show that the quiet curve remains smooth over relatively long periods. Even intraday variations are smooth, suggesting that a more accurate prediction could be achieved by considering a one-month sliding window looking back from the current time. Further breaking this window into three-hour daily segments would improve accuracy, as these smaller buckets account for daily variations while maintaining relative homogeneity. A month-long window is ideal due to seasonal stability in the quiet curve, and since it continuously updates, it ensures accuracy with minimal heterogeneity. For each magnetometer, only data points with a K index below 2 will be used, filtering out geomagnetic disturbances. The quiet curve will evolve dynamically as the window shifts, and any measurements will be made against the predicted quiet curve for that specific period.

To calculate the Q index, another short 15-minute sliding window (as described by J. Bartel) will be applied. The maximum deviation from the predicted quiet curve within this 15-minute period will then be mapped to the corresponding Q index. One might question why a model spanning from 2017 onwards is necessary if only a one-month sliding window is used. As solar maximum intensifies, consistently finding three-hour daily windows with a K index below 2 may become challenging for high-latitude observatories. A threshold must be established for the minimum required data to generate a reliable quiet curve estimate. In such cases, it may be beneficial to compare both values and determine which to use. These decisions can be incorporated into the system, and maintaining both models will be valuable for future analysis and refinement. I will also validate the model using my own past experiences observing auroras in Alaska and other locations.

# Future Work

Once I have a reasonably accurate Q index model for any observatory, I will deploy it as a web service to make the data easily accessible. My next step will be to develop a scoring model, associating each prediction with auroral images captured at the corresponding location and time. I have a vast collection of images, real-time videos, and time-lapses from across interior Alaska that I will use for initial scoring. My long-term goal is to integrate past and live feeds from multiple webcams across the United States and continuously refine the model through ongoing validation.

Ultimately, I aim to predict how the aurora will visually appear by analyzing magnetometer data. As I move toward combining these individual models into a comprehensive global model for all locations, I will explore advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks, once the independent models reach an acceptable level of accuracy.
